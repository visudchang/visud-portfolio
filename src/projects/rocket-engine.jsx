        Regeneratively Cooled Rocket Engine Simulation

      <p>
        This project models a regeneratively cooled rocket engine using SolidWorks and Flow Simulation. It analyzes heat transfer and coolant flow through semicircular channels under extreme thermal loading conditions. The design includes a tangential inlet manifold, 36 cooling channels, and a custom nozzle contour, with performance goals focused on thermal protection and even coolant distribution.
